 "Shock Wave", a test problem in Ascher, Mattheij, and
 Russell, Numerical Solution of Boundary Value Problems 
 for Ordinary Differential Equations", Classics in Applied 
 Mathematics Series, SIAM, Philadelphia, 1995. Ch1 page 21 Example 1.17
 
 Describes a shock in a one dimensional nozzle. The system is defined by 
 steady state Navier Stokes.
 
 You may attempt to view the example though Google Books (first result):
 http://books.google.com/books?id=03O-S66kpMQC&lpg=PP1&dq=%22Numerical%20Solution%20of%20Boundary%20Value%20Problems%20for%20Ordinary%20Differential%20Equations%22%22&pg=PA21#v=onepage&q=shock%20wave&f=false
 
 These kinds of problems generally require continuation methods, where
 you repeatedly solve the problem using smaller and smaller eps value
 but here we solve the bvp directly.
 
 
 problem specification:
 
     eps * A(x) * u*u"  - [(1 + g)/2 - eps * A'(x)] * u * u' +
     u'/u + A'(x)/A(x) * (1 - (g - 1)/2 * u**2 ) = 0 
     
     0 < x < 1
     
     where A(x) = 1 + x**2 
     g = 1.4
     
     BC: 
     u(0) = .9129
     u(1) = .375
 
 A is the area of the nozzle at x
 u is a normalized velocity
 eps is an inverse reynolds number
